Hapag-Lloyd with decrease in earnings in first nine months of 2023


 Freight rates declined further in the third quarter
 Transport volume up in the third quarter, stable year-to-date
 Terminal activities reported separately in new business segment
 Earnings forecast for 2023 specified


Hapag-Lloyd has concluded the first nine months of 2023 with a Group EBITDA=
 of USD 4.5 billion (EUR 4.2 billion) and a Group EBIT of USD 3.0 billion (=
EUR 2.8 billion). The Group profit stood at USD 3.4 billion (EUR 3.2 billio=
n). These results are significantly below the prior-year level due to the s=
evere change in market conditions. With the further expansion of its termin=
al business, the Hapag-Lloyd Group=E2=80=99s business activities have also =
been split for the first time into Liner Shipping and Terminal &amp; Infras=
tructure segments.

In the first nine months of 2023, the EBITDA in the Liner Shipping segment =
decreased to USD 4.5 billion (EUR 4.1 billion). The EBIT fell to USD 3.0 bi=
llion (EUR 2.7 billion). Revenues decreased to USD 15.2 billion (EUR 14.1 b=
illion), primarily due to a lower average freight rate of 1,604 USD/TEU (9M=
 2022: 2,938 USD/TEU). This dropped even further in Q3 2023, to USD 1,312/T=
EU (Q3 2022: USD 3,106/TEU), and it was much lower in several trades compar=
ed to the same period of the prior year. In contrast, the transport volumes=
 improved in the third quarter, rising by just under 5 percent, to 3,110 TT=
EU (Q3 2022: 2,975 TTEU). As a result, the combined volumes of 8,916 TTEU i=
n the first nine months of the year were almost on a par with those of the =
prior-year period (9M 2022: 8,987 TTEU).

Transport expenses experienced a year-on-year decrease of 11 percent, to US=
D 9.6 billion (EUR 8.9 billion), owing in particular to the ongoing normali=
sation of global supply chains as well as a lower average bunker consumptio=
n price of USD 611 per tonne (9M 2022: 755 USD/t).

In the Terminal &amp; Infrastructure segment, an EBITDA of USD 38 million (=
EUR 35 million) and an EBIT of USD 29 million (EUR 27 million) were achieve=
d in the first nine months of 2023. Since the new segment is still in the p=
rocess of being formed, it does not reflect the results of a full nine-mont=
h period. It comprises Hapag-Lloyd=E2=80=99s stakes in 20 terminals in Euro=
pe, Latin America, the United States, India and North Africa as well as oth=
er infrastructure participations.

=E2=80=9CThanks to an increase in transport volumes in the third quarter, v=
olumes are roughly flat for the nine-month period compared to 2022. At the =
same time, we have continued to implement our strategic agenda, expanded ou=
r terminal portfolio, and boosted customer satisfaction again through quali=
ty improvements. However, freight rates are below the prior-year level and,=
 as expected, fell again in the third quarter =E2=80=93 which is reflected =
in much lower earnings. In response, we are working hard to reduce our expe=
nses even more, such as by achieving savings on the procurement side and ma=
king adjustments to our service network. Nevertheless, if spot rates do not=
 recover, we could face some challenging quarters in this subdued market en=
vironment,=E2=80=9D said Rolf Habben Jansen, CEO of Hapag-Lloyd AG.

For the full year 2023, Hapag-Lloyd has made the forecast it published on 2=
 March more specific. EBITDA is now expected to be in the range of USD 4.5 =
to 5.5 billion (EUR 4.1 to 5 billion) and EBIT to be in the range of USD 2.=
4 to 3.4 billion (EUR 2.2 to 3.1 billion). This forecast is subject to unce=
rtainty given the many geopolitical conflicts, persistent inflationary pres=
sures, and the continued high inventory levels of many customers.

<div class=3D"break-word news_main"><p><b>Hapag-Lloyd with decrease in earn=
ings in first nine months of 2023</b></p>

<ul type=3D"square">
 <li>Freight rates declined further in the third quarter</li>
 <li>Transport volume up in the third quarter, stable year-to-date</li>
 <li>Terminal activities reported separately in new business segment</li>
 <li>Earnings forecast for 2023 specified</li>
</ul>

<p>Hapag-Lloyd has concluded the first nine months of 2023 with a Group EBI=
TDA of USD 4.5 billion (EUR 4.2 billion) and a Group EBIT of USD 3.0 billio=
n (EUR 2.8 billion). The Group profit stood at USD 3.4 billion (EUR 3.2 bil=
lion). These results are significantly below the prior-year level due to th=
e severe change in market conditions. With the further expansion of its ter=
minal business, the Hapag-Lloyd Group=E2=80=99s business activities have al=
so been split for the first time into <b>Liner Shipping</b> and Terminal &a=
mp; Infrastructure segments.</p>

<p>In the first nine months of 2023, the EBITDA in the <b>Liner Shipping se=
gment </b>decreased to USD 4.5 billion (EUR 4.1 billion). The EBIT fell to =
USD 3.0 billion (EUR 2.7 billion). Revenues decreased to USD 15.2 billion (=
EUR 14.1 billion), primarily due to a lower average freight rate of 1,604 U=
SD/TEU (9M 2022: 2,938 USD/TEU). This dropped even further in Q3 2023, to U=
SD 1,312/TEU (Q3 2022: USD 3,106/TEU), and it was much lower in several tra=
des compared to the same period of the prior year. In contrast, the transpo=
rt volumes improved in the third quarter, rising by just under 5 percent, t=
o 3,110 TTEU (Q3 2022: 2,975 TTEU). As a result, the combined volumes of 8,=
916 TTEU in the first nine months of the year were almost on a par with tho=
se of the prior-year period (9M 2022: 8,987 TTEU).</p>

<p>Transport expenses experienced a year-on-year decrease of 11 percent, to=
 USD 9.6 billion (EUR 8.9 billion), owing in particular to the ongoing norm=
alisation of global supply chains as well as a lower average bunker consump=
tion price of USD 611 per tonne (9M 2022: 755 USD/t).</p>

<p>In the <b>Terminal &amp; Infrastructure </b>segment, an EBITDA of USD 38=
 million (EUR 35 million) and an EBIT of USD 29 million (EUR 27 million) we=
re achieved in the first nine months of 2023. Since the new segment is stil=
l in the process of being formed, it does not reflect the results of a full=
 nine-month period. It comprises Hapag-Lloyd=E2=80=99s stakes in 20 termina=
ls in Europe, Latin America, the United States, India and North Africa as w=
ell as other infrastructure participations.</p>

<p>=E2=80=9CThanks to an increase in transport volumes in the third quarter=
, volumes are roughly flat for the nine-month period compared to 2022. At t=
he same time, we have continued to implement our strategic agenda, expanded=
 our terminal portfolio, and boosted customer satisfaction again through qu=
ality improvements. However, freight rates are below the prior-year level a=
nd, as expected, fell again in the third quarter =E2=80=93 which is reflect=
ed in much lower earnings. In response, we are working hard to reduce our e=
xpenses even more, such as by achieving savings on the procurement side and=
 making adjustments to our service network. Nevertheless, if spot rates do =
not recover, we could face some challenging quarters in this subdued market=
 environment,=E2=80=9D said Rolf Habben Jansen, CEO of Hapag-Lloyd AG.</p>

<p>For the full year 2023, Hapag-Lloyd has made the forecast it published o=
n 2 March more specific. EBITDA is now expected to be in the range of USD 4=
.5 to 5.5 billion (EUR 4.1 to 5 billion) and EBIT to be in the range of USD=
 2.4 to 3.4 billion (EUR 2.2 to 3.1 billion). This forecast is subject to u=
ncertainty given the many geopolitical conflicts, persistent inflationary p=
ressures, and the continued high inventory levels of many customers.</p>
